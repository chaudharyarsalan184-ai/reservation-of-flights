<h4>Best Time to visit Austin:</h4>
<p>The best times to visit Austin are from September to November or March to May, when the 70s and 80s are the anticipated daytime temperatures. However, as temperatures climb into the mid-to-high 90s with high humidity, the Texan summer, which is from June through August, makes it barely tolerable for unaccustomed visitors.</p>
