    <h1>Book Cheap Flights to Denver</h1>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Denver</strong>, the capital and most populous city of Colorado, is an American metropolis dating to the Old West. It is an outdoor city known for its thriving craft breweries, world-class cultural attractions, chef-driven dining, and red-hot music scene, all within easy reach of the Rocky Mountains. The Larimer Square, the city's oldest block, features landmark 19th-century buildings.</p>
     <br>
        <h2>Why book tickets to Denver?</h2>
    <p><strong>Float in the rivers of Upper Colorado: </strong>Experience the serene calm of a leisurely white-water rafting trip down the Upper Colorado River, taking in the encompassing wilderness. Since it's more of a slow-paced leisurely float, bring along your camera to capture unique shots as you wind your way through a canyon.</p>
<br>
    <p><strong>Soar down from the skies of Denver:</strong>Take a guided mount climbing trip on a Via Ferrata and soar down the zipline from above, saying hello to the open skies and gushing wind. The tickets to this must be booked a day early to confirm your slot.</p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>Take a UTV tour:</strong> Experience the thrill of trekking through the mountains on a UTV along with your friends and family. Choose between being the driver or the passenger. It would be best to be at least five years old to enjoy as a passenger or 18 years old to drive the thrill machine.</p>
